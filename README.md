## Module 1: Introduction to [Websockets]

**Date Started:** 2025-04-20

**Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD (Optional)

* **Key Concepts:**
  
    * What are websockets and Why are Websockets used?: Brief explanation or definition.
      - Think of regular web communication like sending a letter: you send a request (the letter),
        and the server sends back a response (the reply). Once you get the reply, that connection is pretty much done.
      - WebSockets are different. Imagine it's like having a constant phone call
        open between your browser and the server. Once the "call" (connection) is
        established, both sides can send messages back and forth instantly,
        without having to make a new request every single time.
      - So, instead of constantly asking "Hey, anything new?" (like with regular web requests), the server can just push updates to you as soon as they
        happen, and you can send information back just as quickly. This makes things like live chats, real-time games, and instant notifications possible
        without constant refreshing
      - Intrusively put, WebSockets keep the lines of communication wide open and buzzing with activity once they're set up
